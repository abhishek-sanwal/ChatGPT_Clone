<h2 align="center"> ChatGPT Clone üöÄüöÄ</h2>

---

### Ideaü§î

- Original Idea was to built a platform where we can simultaneously prompt to multiple llm models.
- Especially **Gemini** and **GPT** and gather as much as information to solve our problem.
- But since gpt apis are less generousü•≤ and not free to use even for devs I built this.

---

### Featuresüòç

- **Interactive chat** which increase the efficiency of llm to solve your problem.
- Fully synced will **Local Storage**. You will not loose any response even without login.
- **Highlighting syntax** and **typing effect** is included to make it feel like chatgpt.
- All sorts of content is possible like **markdown, db codes, programming codes** etc.
